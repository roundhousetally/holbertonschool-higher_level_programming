## This repo contains higher-level programming projects for the Foundations Curriculum at Holberton.
Projects cover the fundamentals of object oriented programming. This repo is 85% python but includes some html/css/javascript. MySQL and SQLalchemy are also covered during this portion of the curriculum.

These projects are my first experiences in working with Object Oriented Programming. Through this repo I have learned that in Python, everything is object. Python was invented  by Guido Van Rossum in 1991 just two years after I was born, isn't that fantastic?
